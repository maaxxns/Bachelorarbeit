abstract = {We demonstrate the generation $\mu$J-level, single-cycle terahertz pulses by optical rectification from a large-aperture ZnTe single crystal wafer. Energies up to 1.5 $\mu$J per pulse and a spectral range extending to 3 THz were obtained using a 100 Hz Ti:sapphire laser source and a 75-mm-diameter, 0.5-mm-thick, (110) ZnTe crystal, corresponding to an average power of 150 $\mu$W and an energy conversion efficiency of 3.1 {\texttimes} 10-5. We also demonstrate real-time imaging of the focused terahertz beam using a pyroelectric infrared camera.},
