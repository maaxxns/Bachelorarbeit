2_11_30 was highest power ZnTe with post pulse.
also shows a nice FFT.

1_14_29 was ZnTe with the lowest power measured.
Really noisy, but maybe good too understand the diffrence

GaP14_55_42 is the highest pump power with GaP.
Very noisy but shows a peak

GaP14_20_20 is GaP with lowest power. It has a almost undistingishable peak. Way too much noise
