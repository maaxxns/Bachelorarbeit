\chapter{Results}
This section will present the results of the measurements with ZnTe and GaP as emitter crystals.
Calculations will be made to determine the electricfield strength of the produced $\si{\tera\hertz}$ radiation aswell as the Power of said radiation.
Futher a comparission between the different spectras of ZnTe and GaP will be shown and the efficiency in producing radiation will be discussed.

\section{Zinc telluride}
To take this measurments a $\SI{1}{\milli\meter}$ thick ZnTe crystal is used as the emitter.
Another $\SI{1}{\milli\meter}$ thick ZnTe crystal is used as the detector.
