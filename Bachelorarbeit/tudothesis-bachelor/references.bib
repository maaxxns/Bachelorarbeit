The ‘terahertz gap’ has a frequency ranges from ∼0.3 THz to ∼10 THz in the electromagnetic spectrum which in between microwave and infrared. The terahertz radiations are invisible to naked eye & in comparison with X-ray they are intrinsically safe, non-destructive and non-invasive. This is such a new field that researchers around the world race to build the first practical system. It resolves many of the questions left unanswered by complementary techniques, such as optical imaging, Raman and infrared. Terahertz spectroscopy has number of applications run from detecting defects in tablet coating, product inspection (industry), spectroscopy (chemistry, astronomy), material characterization (physics), weapons concealed under clothing (airports), detection of cancer and caries. In the pharmaceutical industries it enables nondestructive, internal, chemical analysis of tablets, capsules and other dosage forms. This paper tries therefore not only to provide a brief overview over the imaging technology, but also over the whole range of current systems and research in terahertz technology.}

    abstract = {The reflection spectrum of the explosive RDX was acquired from a diffuse reflection measurement using a THz time-domain spectroscopy system in combination with a diffuse reflectance accessory. By applying the Kramers-Kronig transform to the reflection spectrum, the absorption spectrum (0.2--1.8 THz) was obtained. It agrees with the result from a transmission measurement and distinguishes RDX from other materials. The effect of the reference spectrum was examined by using both a Teflon pellet and a copper plate as references. The strong absorption of RDX at 0.82 THz allowed it to be identified by the diffuse reflection measurement even when the RDX sample was covered with certain optically opaque materials. Our investigation demonstrates that THz technique is capable of detecting and identifying hidden RDX-related explosives in a diffuse reflection mode, which is crucial for the standoff detection in the real world applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Organic crystals with second-order optical nonlinearity feature very high and ultra-fast optical nonlinearities and are therefore attractive for various photonics applications. During the last decade, they have been found particularly attractive for terahertz (THz) photonics. This is mainly due to the very intense and ultra-broadband THz-wave generation possible with these crystals. We review recent progress and challenges in the development of organic crystalline materials for THz-wave generation and detection applications. We discuss their structure, intrinsic properties, and advantages compared to inorganic alternatives. The characteristic properties of the most widely employed organic crystals at present, such as DAST, DSTMS, OH1, HMQ-TMS, and BNA are analyzed and compared. We summarize the most important principles for THz-wave generation and detection, as well as organic THz-system configurations based on either difference-frequency generation or optical rectification. In addition, we give state-of-the-art examples of very intense and ultra-broadband THz systems that rely on organic crystals. Finally, we present some recent breakthrough demonstrations in nonlinear THz photonics enabled by very intense organic crystalline THz sources, as well as examples of THz spectroscopy and THz imaging using organic crystals as THz sources for various scientific and technological applications.},

abstract = {It is commonly adopted that the widely used method of terahertz generation by tilted-pulse-front pumping of a lithium niobate crystal is optimized when both the tilted front of the pump optical pulse and the image of the diffraction grating, which introduces the tilt, are parallel to the exit surface of the crystal. We consider more general situations. In particular, we show that a deviation of the grating image plane from parallel to the crystal exit surface leads to deterioration of the terahertz beam quality but does not significantly affect the terahertz energy. If the grating image plane and the crystal exit surface are mutual parallel, but they are nonparallel to the pulse front, the terahertz beam quality remains unaffected and the terahertz energy can be unexpectedly higher (about two times for pump pulses of a ~400 fs duration) than in the standard scheme. We propose a modified design of the tilted-pulse-front scheme based on our findings.},
